/*
A great memory-free trick for ensuring that the interface is satisfied at run time is to insert the following into our code:

var _ io.Reader = (*MockReader)(nil)

This checks the assertion but doesnâ€™t allocate anything, which lets us make sure that the interface is correctly implemented at compile time, before the program actually runs into any functionality using it. An optional trick, but helpful.
